===================================
This is a required file for all WordPress themes, so you can't just delete it.

USE OLD FASIONED CSS:
If you don't want to use SASS (or don't know what SASS is) - then you can go ahead and just work in good, old-fashioned CSS within this very file.

TO USE SASS:
Keep in mind that if you DO want to use SASS, you will still need to setup a compiler (e.g. libsass, CodeKit, Gulp, etc) *and* the Zurb Foundation framework (even if you want to use a compiler like CodeKit).
